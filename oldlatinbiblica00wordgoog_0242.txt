x INTRODUCTION

the work done by his predecessorS, and the help that it has been to him ς
while at the same time he may hope to advance somewhat beyond them,
to finish what they have begun, to use the clues which they have
furnished, to decipher pages which they-found hopeless, and to revise
and occasionally to correct their own readings. I feel therefore that no
apology is needed for my venturing to supplement Mr. Belsheim’s work
with the present edition, as M. Samuel Berger'some few years ago sup-

· plemented his edition of the F leury Palimpsest ¹. ·

He indeed it was who first impressed upon me the advisability of
visiting Vienna and trying whether additional study and younger eyes
might not succeed in deciphering more of the MS., and possibly cor-
recting some of Belsheim's work3 and I was able to devote a fortnight
out of a July holiday in 1895 to this purpose. Ἴ

At first sight to me, as to Belsheim, the Palimpsest appeared utterly
hopeless3 in many of the leaves the first writing has completely dis-
appeared ; in others it can only be traced by marking where the scribe's
pen has roughened the surface of the parchment3 in others the ink has
eaten through, and the letters can only be traced by holding the page
against the light3 and where this is the case with the writing on both
sideS‚ the task of deciding to which side any one letter or part of a letter
belongS, is not an easy one ; the parchment too is in many cases so thin,
that the employment of a re-agent, even were it allowed by the author-
ities in the Library, would probably do more harm than good. The
faesimile² which accompanies this edition represents the easiest page in
the MS., and consequently gives no idea of the difficulty of nearly all the
other pages.

beginning with the easier pages; and after a few days I was agreeably
