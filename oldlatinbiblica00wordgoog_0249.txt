illegible in these quaternion3‚ that the actual amount transcribed in the
Catholic Epistles exceeds that in the ActS.

ᾧ 3. Text. (α) Acts. The nature and relations of the various MSS.
and versions in the Acts have been so thoroughly discussed of late,
especially since the appearance of Prof. Blass' edition of that book ¹,
that it would be useless to burden this introduction with a full account
of all that has been said or argued on the subject; the object of this
edition is not to add another dissertation on the text, but simply to
present one of the oft-quoted MSS., so sar as may be, in a fuller and
clearer form. It is sufficient to state here the main grouping of the
MSS. so that the reader may know in what family to look for most
resemblances to the Bobbio palimpsest.

MSS. of the Acts may be divided, as Blass and others have noticed ²,
into three groupS. F irst, that headed by the ‘neutral' MSS. NABC
and the Vulgate as represented in such MSS. as Amiatinus and
Fuldensis. Second, the ‘Western Text,’ represented by Codex Bezae
(D* and d*) and the Harkleian Syriae (mainly the margin); a special
branch of this text being formed by the African group of Latin MSS.,
such as the F leury Palimpsest (le), the quotations in Cyprian, and the
African text whose readings are incorporated in Augustine’s Acta contra
Felicem Mamkleaeum ³. Third, the group represented among· Greek
MSS. by the Laudian Acts and the cursive 1373 and among Latin
MSS. by the ‘ European’ texts, viz. the Gigas Holmiensis at Stock-
holm ⁴, the Milan Lectionary known as g2 ⁵, the portions of the Per-
pignan MS. lately published by M. Berger ⁶, the quotations in Lucifer of
