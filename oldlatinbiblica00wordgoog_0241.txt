J. Belsheim, visited Vienna and examined it ¹.

Belsheim relates in his preface that he had been advised by an
English scholar to set to work on the Palimpsest, though he does not say
who the English scholar was, The first impression made on him by the
leaveS, waS, he tells uS‚ that it was quite hopeless to attempt deciphering
more than Tischendorf had already done, and he left Vienna that year
without further work on the MS. A second and longer study of it in the
following year, however, enabled him to decipher ten more pagcs com-
pletely and three partially: these were :—

The deciphering of Palimpsests is usually a matter os gradual
progresS, where each successive student may gratefully acknowledge
