greater seclusion and strictness, as his fame both for preaching and
miracles attracted large crowds of visitors to his present abode. The
Pope, however, compelled him to apply himself afresh to his task of
missionary preaching. On arrivin'g at Maises on the Adige he incurred
the wrath of Duke Grimoald by his boldness in rebuking him for hist
marriage with Pila-ud, the widow of his deceased brother3 and the
persecution of Piltrud, rather than of Grimoald perhapS, forced him to
flee to the Tyrol, whence he returned after the death of Grimoald in 724.

He now founded the Monastery of Freising, on the Isar, in Bavaria,
and dedicated it to the Blessed Virgin and to St. Benedict3 it was raised
to an episcopal seat, and Corbinian was himself the first Bishop.

He died on the 8th of September, 730 A.D., and was succeeded by
his own brother Erimbert. Erimbert was succeeded by Arib0‚ who
transferred the body of Corbinian back to Freising from Maises, whither,
in accordance with his dying request, it had been conveyed. To Aribo
also we are indebted for a life of the Saint and founder of the Monastery1.

The library was founded by Bishop Hitto, the fifth in order from
Corbinian, and received large additions under Bishop Abraham (died
994); but our Manuscript is of course considerably older than the library
to which it belonged; in all probability it was there from the first, as
there are no marks on it to suggest its having been in any other library3
it only bears its present Munich number of Lat. 62243 and its old
Freising number of 24. No Biblical MS. appears in the three very ,
fragmentary lists of books in the library of F reising, reprinted by G.

Becker ², but these are too scanty for any argument to be drawn from
them.
