EXTERNAL DESCRIPTION OF THE FRAGMENTS, ETC. xiii

excluding them ς absolute accuracy is unattainable‚ and the accurate
editor is he who makes the fewest mistakes. Ι may say however that I
have not spared either time or eyesight in my endeavours to obtain
an exact transcript of the Codex3 and that where I have differed from
either Tischendorf or Belsheim, it¹ has not been without a very caresul
and repeated examination of their readings, Ι have followed Belsheim’s
example in placing the Tzlrch„ Behh„ Wh. against the pages which
we have respectively deciphered and published.

ᾧ 2. E xternal description of tlte fragments, siae, date, &a The
Manuscript in its present condition consists of a gathering, not sewed,
of twenty leaves, numbered 42* to 56, and 71 to 75; betweenfols.
56 and 71 has been inserted another loose gathering of fourteen leaves
which we can leave out of our calculationS‚ as it belongs to a different
MS.; there is besides a spare leaf, Fol. 42, which may be part of our
MS., but the first writing is illegible.

The average height and breadth of the pages is c. 23>< 183 the
parchment varieS, some os the leaves being smooth, thin, and still
comparatively white, others rather thicker and darker3 the leaves
have not been mutilated to any serious extent, with the exception
of fols. 42* and 53, but the parchment has worn at the edgeS, and in
a few cases the top or bottom lines os a page have gone, as in sol. 48.

The rulings are on the outside of the sheetS, with a boundary line at
each side; the writing does not depend srom the ruled lineS, but
rests on them. The measurements are as follows z—breadth of page
within rulings c..12. 53 number of lines to a page 24 (sometimes 25) in
Acts, 25 in Epistles (24 in Fol. 72 a): number os letters to a line on the
average about 26, though varying from 20 to 32 or more3 distance
between lines c. 0.7 3 height of average letter c. 0. 5.

The writing has been dated by von Eichenfeld as possibly of the
fourth century, though he rather inclines to the fifth ; Tischendorf thought
the fifth a more probable date ; and later palaeographers seem agreed in
placing it in the fifth, or more probably the sixth century ¹. It is a fine,
bold half-uncial hand, somewhat resembling that of the famous Hilary
