EX TERNAL DESCRIPTION. xi

But though ‘ apparitio ’ seems to be a Spanish word, and is given by
Isidore of Seville in his Etymologie5‚ yet it is difficult to imagine that
the MS. has a Spanish origin ; it is not written in Visigothic characters, as
one would expect in a Spanish MS. of that date, and the colours em-
ployed in the illumination are not bright and startling as in Spanish
work. The existence os ‘apparitio ’ then must point not to a Spanish
origin of the MS.. but to a more widely diffused ‘use of the term than
has been hitherto supposed.

Gatherings. The gatherings are rather hard to unravel, partly because
1 was unable to discover any signatures‚ and partly from the ruthless
manner in which the various parts of the book have been cut about and
transposed by a later hand, who re-bound it. The binder, being unable to
appreciate the order in which the Gospels were placed, viz. the usual Old-
Latin order of Matthew, John, Luke, and Mark, tried to rearrange them in
the order familiar to us, or at any rate to bring in St. John at the end, for,
aster all, he has made St. Mark come after St. Luke. Of course he could
not succeed, as the same leaf more than once contains the end os one
Gospel on the one side and the beginning of the next on the other, and
this in the Old-Latin order¹; so that his efforts have only succeeded in
cutting up most of the Gospels into fragments, and introducing a general
appearance of confusion into the Book. Probably it was during this
sorcible arrangement of the gatherings that most os the leaves now
missing seu out. A little calculation will however enable us to form a
fair idea as to the original gatherings and their order.

The Manuscript opens with a' ternion (Fol. 1-6); then comes what
appears now as a complete quaternion, but is really a quaternion made
up largely of odd leaves from different parts of the book. The first two,
and also the fifth and sixth leaves os the quaternion proper, are missing3
and these four leaves have for some unknown reason been filled in from
the last two chapters of St. Luke. It must be noticed too that this
gathering was originally irregular, and contained nine leaveS, for Fol. 15,
which naturally would be the beginning of a new gathering‚ is missing3
