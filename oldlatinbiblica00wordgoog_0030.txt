xxvi IN TR ODUC TI ON.

These instances, it is hoped, may shew fairly enough the general ten-
dency os the text of q, and there is little doubt that an extended series
os such tables would do much towards throwing light on the inter·
relations os the Old-Latin texts.

Let us now proceed to a more detailed examination os a few chapters
in each Gospel, and this impression as to the connection of q with b rather
than with f in the main course os its text will, we believe, be strengthened.
At any rate we shall be thus collecting facts which will speak for
themselveS, and though our conclusions may be afterwards modified by
otherS‚ still the collection and arrangement of data may be useful to any
one who in the future may have leisure for a more complete analysis.
To avoid undue length, we have left minor differences and slight varia·
tions of spelling unnoticed‚ and have marked approximate agreement by
placing the MS. in a bracket—(a), (b). It has been thought advisable to
continue the plan adopted by Dr. Sanday in the 2nd vol. os ‘ Old-
Latin Biblical TextS‚' and to place our readings in parallel columns,
giving in the left hand readings in which q differs from f, and in the right
those in which they are agreed against all or most other Old-Latin

authorities.
