TJTLE, NUMBER‚ HISTORY OF THE MS„ ETC. xi

surprised to find that my eyes were becoming more accustomed to it, and
that page after page which at first seemed impossible, was gradually
becoming legible. A magnifying glass of course helped me much, but
though Ι obtained photographs of one or two pageS, I cannot say that
they assisted me to the extent I hoped sor. In this first visit to Vienna
Ι deciphered about hals of the total number of leaves which are here
printed; and in a second fortnight’s study, in September 1896, I tran-
scribed the remainder. Ι have thus been able to revise all the pages
given by Tischendorf and Belsheim, and in certain cases to add more,
where they have given only part. I was also fortunate enough to deci-
pher several pages, both in the Acts and in the Epistles, which have not
been published before. In the Acte, a small portion of Fol. 53a (Acts
xxiii. 15-17), and of F ol. 52 a (xxiv. 5-14 3 here indeed only a few wordS,
but enough to show that v. 7 was absent from the MS.); nearly all of
Fol. 52b (xxiv. 14—23) and 51 a (xxiv. 23—xxv. 2); a few words in Fol.
50b (xxvi. 1—2)‚ and in 48a (xxvii. 44); the greater part of Fol. 48b
(xxviii. 4-9); a few words in Fol. 44b (xxviii. 15-16), and somewhat
more in Fol. 56a (xxviii. 30 ad fin.). In the EpistleS, F ol. 71 a (James
i. 26-ii. 5), the upper part os Fol. 42³⁶b (ii. 6-10; the latter lines have
been printed by Belsheim, who by a slip numbers it 47 b ; but Ι have not
been able to decipher them); Fol. 54b (iv. 2—10), 49 a (iv. 10—v. 3), and
49b (v. 3-11). Thusvat present, out of forty existing pageS‚ twenty-
four have had either the whole or the greater part of their contents
deciphered ; in eight more pages a few lines or a few words can be made
out; and only four still seem absolutely hopeless,

The pages published by Tischendorf were given with very great
accuracy3 his practised eye and hand seldom played him false, and
though I have gone over most of his work two or three times, 1 have
only been able to detect very few and slight errors3 occasionally he has
printed a letter in the text which in the MS. itself has been added by the
corrector above the line; the difference between e and i is not always
observed 3 and on the very hard Fols. 73a and 55 a, Ι have differed
somewhat considerably from him. Yet Ι must thankfully acknowledge
my obligations to him; if Ι had not had his transcript as a sort of key
at starting, Ι could never have obtained that familiarity with the MS.
and its handwriting which has enablcd me to transcribe the other leaves.
