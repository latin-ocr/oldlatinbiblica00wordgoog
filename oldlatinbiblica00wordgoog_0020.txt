copus, censuim, Agusto (Luke ii. 1). Letters are dropped at the end of
words, giving us such forms as accesserun( t), plu(s)‚ ueneri(t), praeparatu(s),
sun(t), uocan(s), and also at the beginning, as in (i)bi, (u)tique. These
instances seem to point to careless pronunciation rather than careless
writing3 but for the following the scribe must surely be responsible :—

frequent use in Cod. Bobiensis k); thensaurus, puplicanus, profeta, adu-
lescens are regularly employed, as also Moyses, not Moses; absconsus,
absconditus are both found; the form nequa is judged by Bishop
Wordsworth to be not a mistake, but an old indeclinable noun ¹.

The other usual contractioris and abbreviations are found3 ds and
dns, isl as a rule for Israel, though its is also found. The line over, or
