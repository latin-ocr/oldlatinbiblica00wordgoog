TEXT xix

(Dr. John Wordsworth) and Prof. Sanday in Studia Biblica1, and the
commentary os Dr. J. B. Mayor ². Doubt has indeed been expressed
as to whether St. Jerome ever did revise the Epistles sor his edition
of the New Testament; no books after the Gospels possess presaces
from his pen, which is strange when we consider his known love for
writing a preface -or an introductory letter to a work whenever he pos—
sibly could ³. ln the case of St. James the rough and strange style
of the Latin has increased the suspicion that here we have a pre-
Hieronymian text which has passed into the Vulgate unchanged. Yet
St. Jerome’s own frequent assertions that he revised the whole New
Testament, and his distinct mention of three passages srom St. Paul's
Epistles which he had emended from the Greek, must overweigh mere
negative evidence on the other side, and make us believe that his revision
went beyond the Gospe15‚ though very possibly it was more hasty and
superficial in the other bookS.

Be this as it may, our own MS. bears a very strong resemblance to
the Vulgate text, though it can hardly be classed as a Vulgate MS. ; the
following variations are perhaps worth noticing :—
