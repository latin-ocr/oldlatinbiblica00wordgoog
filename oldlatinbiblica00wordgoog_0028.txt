In this table the reader cannot fail to be struck with the close
adherence of q to b until we get to the latter chapters of St. john ; there
is not in the first three Gospels a single case of divergence, but they
always change from magnifico to honorifico and back to magnifico
together, while f diverges frequently into glorifico, and in Matt. ix. 8
has magnifico against the honorifico of b, q. The appearance of clarifico
in b in the latter chapters of St. John, and not only in b but in f, whence
it has crept in a few places into the Vulgate, is very puzzling; for clari-
ficoo, from its regular use in the African MSS. e, k, and in the quotations
of African F atherS, would seem to be a distinctly African term 3 q here
agrees with a in reading honorifico (glorifico, it may be noted, is not once
found in q), and it may be possible that in these chapters the text of b
has been slightly corrupted from an African source, while a and q have
preserved the genuine European rendering. Another point worthy of
notice is that in John xiii. 32 q inserts with f the initial clause et si deus
honorificatus est in eo against a, b, d (which omit it and go straight to et
deus honorificabit eum, etc.); but though q agrees with f in the reading, it
differs in the rendering, having honorificatus instead of clarificatus.

Let us take another case, that of ἐπιτιμᾶν, a word which seems to have
much exercised its Latin translatore, as it is rendered in no less than
eleven wayS, by admonere, comminari, corripere (once by comperire in k,
probably by a slip for corripere), emendare, imperare, increpare, minari,
obsecrare, obiurgare, praecipere, prohibere, while r (Cod. Usserianus) ren-
ders it by arguere in Luke xxiii. 40.
