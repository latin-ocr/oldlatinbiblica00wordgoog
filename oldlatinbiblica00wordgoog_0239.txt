TITLE, NUMBER, HISTORY OF THE MS„ ETC. vii

The little that can be known about the history of the MS. is told us
by Denis; it belonged to the famous Monastery os St. Columban at
Bobbi0, from which fact it is still known as a Codex Bobiensis; then to
the Convent of St. John de Carbonaria at Naples, Here Mabillon
inspected it in October 1685, paying attention however only to the upper
writing ¹. From Naples it was brought to Vienna in 1717, with other Mss„
by Alexander Ricardi‚ the first Librarian of the Imperial Library.

Carefully as Denis described the leaveS, he does not appear to have
noticed that more than the first 42 of them were palimpsest ε on f. 42, p. 2,
he remarks ‘ Ceterum lectionem hactenus relatorum per se difficilem
difficiliorem reddit conditio Codicis rescripti ; continebant enim hae
Membranae splendidissimum olim, et Seculi, ut videtur, V. Exemplum
Pharsaliae Lucani litera quadrata luculenta exaratum, quod ita abrasit
infelix ignorantia, ut e vestigiis crocei paene coloris lineas intercur-
rentibus fol. 17. p. 2. eruere potuerim ν. 175. L. V. Hemistichium:
FLAMMASQ. IN mscssRA Manem? ⁵

It was the merit of J. von Eichenfeld, a later librarian at the
Hos-Bibliothek, to call attention to the fact that not simply the leaves
mentioned by DeniS, but 72 leaveS, i. e. nearly half of the MS„ were
palimpsest ². Von Eichenfeld described carefully the fragments of Lucan,
giving a list of variant readings3 described and published in full the
leaves of the Latin Hippiatrika‚ and of the third book of Dioscorides;
and drew attention to the earlier writing on foll. 57, 58, 59, 61, 66,
68, 69, which apparently contain portions of a Greek medical treatise.

What is more important for our purpose, he discovered that under
the upper writing of foll. 42*-—56, and 71—7 5 there lurked portions of an
Old-Latin version of the Acts, and Epistles of James and 1 Peter, though
the extreme difficulty of the palimpsest prevented him from giving more
than a few lines from the easier pages; he remarks ³ ‘ W aren die friiheren

eodem modo dispositus atque in nostro Corbeiensi‚' and p. 111 ‘ Priscianus dc laude Anastasia·
Imperatoris, quod notatu dignum etc. '; Mabillon however was not able to spend so much time in
the Library as he wished; after a few days, the Librarian apparently became suspicions or
jealous; and, alleging the illness of a near relative, left Naples and took the keys with himx
