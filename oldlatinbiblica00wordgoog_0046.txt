all the more valuable, as it will be unconscious testimony disclosed by
the way, when they were being quoted with a different aim.

There are some sixty-three instances in the analysis of a² and s in
which q presents us with readings of any interest as shewing its relation
to other MSS. Out of these sixty-three instances there are thirty-four
of agreement with b against f, and only nine of agreement with f against
ὂς in eight readings q stands alone, and in eight it agrees with the com-
posite text offf2 against both b and f.

To take the more noticeable cases of readz'ng———as opposed to ren-
dering—first: in Luke xi. 13 the clause ‘ cum autem haec dixisset ad-
duxerunt ad eum unum daemoniacum surdum et mutum ' found in f, and
with minor variations in a2, c, d, is omitted by b, i, q and A m.; in v. 22
‘ eius ' is omitted after ‘ spolia ’ in b, q, but inserted in the other MSS.; in
v. 25 ‘ scopis mundatam ’ is read by b, i, q, A m., while f (with l, ὃ) insert
‘vacantem' as we113 in v. 28 ‘ ad eos' is added after ‘ dixit' in b, i, q,
but omitted in d, e, f, Am. ln xiii. 17 the simple ‘praeclarius' is read
in b, i, q against the ‘ uniuersis praeclaris uirtutibus ’ of s, the other MSS.
agreeing in inserting either ‘ uniuersis ’ or ‘ omnibus?

These are all the noticeable cases of differences of reading which
imply a variation in the underlying Greek text, and, as we shall see, they
are paralleled by about an equal number of cases in which q has f readings
opposed to those of ὂς these are as follows :—

Luke xi. 13 ‘ spiritum sanctum,’ f, q, (cp. Am. ‘spiritum bonum’),
against ‘bonum datum ’ or ⁴ bona data’ of the European MSS.; v. 18
the addition of ‘ satanan eicit ’ to ‘ si satanaS‚' before ‘ in seipsum diuisus
est‚' is found in f, i, q, but not in αἳ, b or d ; v. 24 (d) f, q have ‘ loca arida ’
against ‘loca quae non habent aquam ⁹ of b (i), while a2 and Ambrose in
his commentary on St. Luke combine the two readings in ‘arida loca
quae aquam non habent! In xiii. 33 the clause ‘ uerumtamen oportet me
hodie et cras et sequenti ire ' is found with slight variations in f, q, Am„
and, in a slightly different form, also in a, d, e, but is omitted in b, i.
Thus in cases of reading q seems to hold a middle place between b ands
in St. Luke as in the othei· Gospels; it is revised in some place5‚ unre-
vised in others. ’

If we examine its renderings the conclusion suggested by the other
Gospels will be considerably strengthened3 the large majority are dis-
