PRESENT EDITION xxi

and it is here that we find our MS. agreeing with him. ’ We 'may' there-
fore not be wrong in surmising that the elements in the Vienna
palimpsest which are divergent from the Vulgate in these Epistlcs‚
represent a stream of late African text.

ἦ 4. lee present edition. It remains to say a few words on the
form of the present edition. 1 have thought it advisable to represent
by blank pages the leaves which have either disappeared from the three
quaternionS, or are at present undecipherable3 the arrangement and
order of the leaves is thus made clearer, and should any of those which
are now missing be hereafter discovered, or should sharper eyes decipher
pages that were beyond my powerS, the additional matter can be easily
inserted.

The question as to the employment of different kinds of type in
publishing a MS. may easily become a complicated one. Were the
editor of a palimpsest to attempt to express by various modes of
printing his judgement on the readingS, ranging as it does from absolute
certainty to pure conjecture, the resources of the largest type-foundry
would soon be at an end, and the edition would be almost as hard to
understand as the original manuscript. 1 have therefore uniformly printed
in roman type all of the MS. which 1 could decipher with tolerable
confidence, and have postponed to the notes (pp. 51—5 3) observations as
to the doubtfulness of particular pages or lines. But 1 have employed
variations of type in the following caseS. (1) For syllables or words
which are pure conjecture, but about which there can be no reasonable
doubt, I have employed italic type. Ι have however employed italics
sparingly‚ as in many cases the student can easily gucss what is lacking,
while in others there may be two or three possible ways of filling up
the vacant space; but there are cases where the printed page does not
adequately represent the amount vacant or illegible in the MS„ and
where consequently some sort of guide is necessary to indicate the
probable number os the missing letterS‚ and their nature. (2) Round
brackets enclosing letters in ordinary type ( ) are used to indicate letters
or words which are not purely conjectural, but which were too doubtful
to be printed in the same manner as the rest of the MS.; and (3) square
brackets [ ] are employed to enclose the passages which Tischendorf or
