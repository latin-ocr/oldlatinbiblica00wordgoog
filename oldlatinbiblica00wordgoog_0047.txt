RELA TI ΟΝ OF q TO OT HER OLD-LA 7 'IN TEXTS. xliii

tinctly characteristic of the European class of MSS„ and there are but
few in which q agrees with f against the older family. We have the
‘ dabit’ of d, f, i, q, Am. in Luke xi. 11 against the ‘ porriget ’ of a and
b; ‘miratae sunt ’ in v. 14, d, f, q, Am. against the ‘ stupebant ’ οι· ‘ obstu·
pebant ’ of a, b, i, etc-3 ‘ paenitet me' in xvii. 4 with f, Am. against
the ‘ paeniteor' of b, d, and the ‘paenitentiam ago’ of (a) and ες v. 8,
‘ post haec ' with d, f, Am. against the ‘ postea ' of a, e, and the ‘ sic ' of b.
These are about all the cases that we can notice of agreement with the
revised family against the older European group.

On the other side the agreements with b are both numerous and
important, and we may instance: xi. 21, ‘ea quae possidet' (b, q, Am.)
against ‘omnia quae possidet' (s); 22, ‘ distribuet' against ‘dividet'
of f3 xiii. 17, ‘ aduersario eius’ against ‘ qui resistebant ei,' and
‘quae uiderant fieri ad ipso ’ against ‘ quae uidebatur fieri ab eo ’ς
25, ‘ et pulsare’ against ‘et pulsauerit ostium'3 32, ‘ite dicite' against
‘ite et dicite’; xvii. 6, ‘ utique obaudisset uobis’ against ‘ et oboe-
diret uobis ’ς 12, ‘ ingredienti ei ’ against ‘ cum ingrederetur,’ and ‘ quodam
castello ’ against ‘ quoddam castellum '3 1 8, ‘ rediret et . . . ageret' against
⁸ reuerteretur et daret,’ and ‘gratias ’ against ‘ gloriam ’ς 22, ‘ ut ’ instead
of ‘quando ’ before ‘ desideretis ' ; 24, ‘ fulgurans de caelo lucet in his sub
caelo sunt ' is read by b, q alone, against ‘coruscans in his quae sub
caelo sunt fulget ’ off, while the other MSS. differ both from f and q,
and also among themselves; 27, ‘ nubebant' against ‘nubtum dabant ’3
xix. 4, ‘illa parte ’ against ‘inde ’ς 7, ‘ murmurauerunt ’ against ‘ murmu-
rabant: and ‘deuertit’ against ‘intrauit '3 8, ‘ quid alicui ’ against ‘ quid
aliquem' 3 15, ‘ quantum quisque' against ⁸ quis quantum.' These in-
stances‚ and more might be quoted, shew pretty conclusively‚ we think,
that in the great mass of the text and in turns of expression q is really
a text of the b and not of the s type.

The peculiar readings of q in these chapters do not seem to present
us with anything striking, or suggestive as to any further light on the
origin of the MS.; they are as follows z—xi. 16, ‘ ab eo de celo quaere-
bant‚’ qstanding alone in arranging the words in this order; 20, ‘ utique '
before ‘ praeuenit ' against the ‘ certe ’ of αἳ, ‘ profecto ’ off, i, Am„ ‘ for-
sitam’ of d 3 xiii. 24, ‘querunt introire et non potuerunt ’ against the

‘ quaerunt intrare et non poterunt ' of most of the other MSS. In xvii. 7
