The notes which 1 have added to the Iessons are principally the
suggestions kindly offered by the Rev. W. C. Bishop3 the term ‘Am-
brosian ' refers to the Ambrosian MS. lectionary‚ the oldest known3 a
proof of which Dr. Ceriani had sent him.

Ι may also add a list of the following passages to which the crosses
to mark a lesson have been attached, though the title of‘ the lesson
itself has either never been added, or else has disappeared by being cut
off with the margin of the page by the binder t—Matt. v. 1 ; vi. 16 *inc.,
viii. 14 ; ix. 183 x. 323 xiii. 433 xv. 21, 29, the title of the lesson has
been cut off here, 32, 393 xvii. 14, xviii. 23, xix. 16, xxi. 5, no cross here,
but the title of a Iesson, which has been cut off, and similarly against
