xviii INTRODUCTION

Cainari, and our own MS. s ; to these must be added the Speculum (m),
late African and Spanish. Few of these authorities, however, are extant
for the parts of the Acts preserved in the Vienna fragments3 D stops
short at xxii. 29, E is deficient between xxvi. 29 and xxviii. 26; h is
wanting between xxiii. 24 and xxvi. 20, and after xxvii. 133 g2 only
contains vi. 8-vii. 13 51—viii. 43 the Perpignan MS. is Old—Latin from
i. 1 to xiii. 6 and from xxviii. 16 to the end, the rest of the book being
a Vulgate text; the portion of the Acts preserved in the Augustinus
contra Felicem consists only of the first chapter and eleven verses of the
second3 and the excerpts in the Speculum (m) do not proceed beyond
chapter xxiii. Thus for the chapters given us by the Vienna palimpsest
we have little Latin attestation beyond the Gigas and the Vulgate.

There is no doubt whatever as to the relation of our MS. with the
Gigas3 it is an extremely close one ; out of some hundred cases of notice-
able variation from the Vulgate text, s is in complete agreement with
the Gigas in nearly fifty, and in approximate agreement in about eleven
more3 yet the Gigas has the additional clauses ‘Intercedens autem
Lysias tribunus curn ui magna eripuit eum de manibus nostris ' xxiv. 7,
‘sed ut animam meam a morte liberarem ' xxviii. 19, and ‘ Et cum haec
dixisset exierunt iudei magnam inter se habentes questionem ’ xxviii. 29,
which are all wanting in s; the common interpolation in the last verse of
the book ‘quia hic est iesus filius dei per quem incipiet totus mundus
indicari ’ is found in the Perpignan MS. but neither in s nor in the Gigas.

The MS. it must be allowed does not offer any very striking pecu-
liarities of text or of rendering3 the variants from the Vulgate are most
frequent in the 27th chapter3 but the use of ‘continentia’ xxiv. 25 for
‘ castitate’ of the Vulgate and the Gigas, ‘ legatus’ xxvi. 30 with Ιι ng.
for ‘ praeses’ of the Vulgate, ‘ et . . . uinctos’ xxvii. ι for ‘cum . . . cus-
todiis,’ ‘catenam hanc porto' xxviii. 20, are also worthy os notice as
interesting renderings.

(β) St. James. The text of St. James has also received adequate
attention of late years3 it is only necessary to mention the articles
on the Corbey MS. of St. James (ff) by the present Bishop of Salisbury
