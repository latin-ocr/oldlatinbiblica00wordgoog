EX TERNAL DES CRIP TI ON. xv

more often, 1 think, the result of carelessness on the part of the scribe
than os intention. vBut although the very formation of his handwriting
and the numberless corrections of his own slips by himself, shew him to
have been a careless writer, it is at the same time unadvisable to dismiss ,
the problem of a peculiarly-spelt word on the ground os carelessness,
until other means os 'solving it have failed. A fuller comparative
examination of early Latin MSS. may strengthen the supposition
that cases of apparently careless spelling may be really due not to
accident, but to different modes of pronunciation current in the regions to
which the MS. or its ancestors belonged: and thus the orthography of a
MS. may throw great lighton the origin of the text which it presents.
1 have therefore collected some of the more regularly recurring cases of
peculiar orthography in q.

In the vowels ae and e seem interchangeable; Iudea and Iudaea are
found impartially3 Abraee in Luke iii. 8 ; Esaias and AEsaias, Matt. xv.
73 xiii. 14; Cesar, Matt. xxii. 21 ; egrimonia‚ terre, prestat, etc.; and on
the other hand aedunt, blasfaemiae‚ kabaebat, occultae3 a is found occa-
sionally for e: genarati0, Matt. xxiv. 343 processarat, Luke ii. 36 3 u and
0 are occasionally interchanged: soffuco and suffuco, Matt. xiii. 7, 223
Luke viii. 7, 14, 333 diurnu, Matt. xx. 2 ; pseadaxfii‚ Matt. xxiv. 243 and
speodaprofetis, Luke vi. 26. In the consonants we may notice examples
of ‘dittography,’ consummat, Luke ix. 543 atullerunt, John ii. 8 ,⁸ and
Iordannis usually (but not john iii. 26, etc.); s is more frequently doubled,
as in accussarent, effussus, accissa, transsire, etc.‚ and is frequently added
as ter x, as in benedixserin t, dixserunt, crucifixserun t, in allusistis, surrexsit,
exsiens, exsemplum, exsercitum‚ mamillam, ete.; and yet side by side with
these we have such forms as audisent‚ ingresus, percusit, misus, posumus ‚⁰
the omission and insertion of l2 seem to shew that then as now that
letter had an uncertain foothold in popular pronunciation, and, expelled
from places to which it rightly belonged, revenged itsels by trespassing
where it had no claim3 we have on the one hand abuisti, ora (haur), odie,
ospes, proibere, etc.‚ and on the other hira, habundantius, learidarum,
habiit, hista, etc. The omission os other letters may be due partly to
slovenly and hasty pronunciation, partly to careless writing3 we have
mandcare, pecctum, mlites, spientibus, in which not only a letter but a
syllable is lost, and also autm and atem (for autem), sient (for scient), ’
