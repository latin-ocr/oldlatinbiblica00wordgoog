(γ) 1 St. Peter. The amount of other Old-Latin attestation for the
portions of this Epistle preserved in our MS. is extremely small ;
neither the fragments in the Fleury palimpsest, nor those in the Munich
MS. published by Ziegler and quoted as q ¹, overlap for more than a verse
or two3 and thus it is by comparison not so much with Manuscripts as
with quotations from F atherS, that we may hope to attain to any results
as to the nature of our text. Nor shall we gain very much, for the text
in 1 Peter, as in James, is practically a Vulgate text. Yet there are
a few variants which will be seen to be not without interest ςέ-

The agreements with Augustine here are counterbalanced by the
disserences; but those with q, Fulgentius os Ruspe, and Facundus
(Bp. of Ermione or Hermione in the province of Byzacena in Africa,

and writing in the latter half of the sixth century), are more instructive.
Ziegler himself has laid stress on the similarity of text in q and
Fulgentius ; and here we have another case os variants from the Vulgate
text meaning agreements with an African Father. The New Testament
of Facundus is certainly, like that of Angustiae, a ‘ very variable
quantity’ 3 in the Gospels he seems to use pure Vulgate, though he once
quotes Joh. xvi. 13 ‘inducet uos in omnem ueritatem ’ (cf. ‘ inducet uobis
uer. omn! e), and in the Pauline Epistles his variations from the Vulgate
are slight (occurring mainly in Corinthians and Colossians); it is in the
Catholic EpistleS, 1 John, and 1 and 2 Peter that they are most marked:
