xiv . θ INTRODUCTION

in the Archives of St. Peter’s at Rome, written before 509—510 A.D¹;
the letters in ourMS. however are larger3 the cross-stroke of the e
higher and finer, the a more decidedly open, and the t somewhat broader 2;
with d r s double forms occur, both uncial and half-uncial, though the
uncial form of the s only occurs in the introductory lines of the EpistleS.
The titles and subscriptions to the books are written in capitaIS, and the
first few lines os a new book in slightly larger unciaIS. The only con-
tractions arethe usual ᾱὲ, dns, ὣς, Χρε, 8138, 8683 m or n is marked by
a line over the letter it follows, and q, is occasionally found for que;
combinations of letters are found in the cases osam, nf, nt, or. A single
middle point is the only punctuation employed, the writing being
continuouS, though a new sentence will have its capital letter indented
somewhat to the left os the other lines, Colour does not seem to have
been used in the ornamentation of the MS.; and there are very few
corrections.

Gatherings. A very short inspection of the list of leaves and their
contents (pp. viii, ix, xi) will show that their present order does not
represent that in which they originally stood3 they have been made up
into new gatheringS, and in many cases folded inside out or turned upside
down. Yet as the amount os matter is fairly equal in all the page3‚ it is
not a very hard task to reconstruct the original form and position of the
gatheringS, and to calculate what the lost leaves must have contained,
and what verses must have been written on the pages which are still
illegible.

We have the greater part of three quaternion3‚ of which the first
and most of the second contained Acts xxii. 29 or thereabouts to the
end of the book; the third gathering, and the last leaf of the second,
contain the Epistles of James and 1 Peter to ii. ¹03 the Epistle os James
follows immediately after the ActS, but as no traces of signatures to the
gatherings have as yet been discovered, we cannot tell whether the MS.
was originally a complete New Testament, or whether it only contained
the Acts and Catholic EpistleS.

It would be needless to detail all the calculations by which it may
