xii INTRODUCTION .

From Belsheim’s edition it will be seen that I differ sar more frequently
and widely. Haste indeed, and consequent inaccuracy in small details,
seem to mark it throughout ς’ thus the folio numbers are frequently given
wrong (e. g. Fol. 50 b ahould be 50 a, 35 b should be 45 b, 47 b should be
42* b, 41a should be 42* a), and the pages which he professes (p. 7)
to have simply reprinted from Tischendorf contain noticeable varia-
tions from the copy3 e. g. Fol. 56b (Acts xxviii. 23) Tischendorf had
printed de itu, a pardonable slip for de inu, which is the actual reading os
the Codex; in Belsheim’s edition this appears, without a note os explan-
ation, as de ritu, which is thus neither the reading of Tischendorf, nor
that of the Codex 3 and similar inaccuracies appear in the pages which he
has himself transcribed. Yet combined with this haste and carelessness
in details is a considerable amount of acuteness in deciphering the harder
leaves; and it would be unjust not to acknowledge Mr. Belsheim’s
boldness and persever-auce in attacking a MS. the difficulty of which
can only be estimated by those who have tried to work at it. What
M. Samuel Berger said os his edition of the Fleury Palimpsest‚ Ι can
heartily echo; ‘Si aujourd'hui on peut lire plus et mieux qu’il n’a fait,
c’est a lui qu’on le doit ’ ¹3 it is his own work thch has enabled me to
read more than he has done, and to correct much that he has published.
It will be seen that Ι have given in the notes all the instances where
I have differed from Tischendorf, but not those where I differ from
Belsheim3 to have enumerated them would have produced a totally false
impression‚ as it would have drawn the reader’s attention simply to
the points where Ι believe him to have been mistaken, and not to the far
larger number where he is correct, and where Ι might never have
deciphered the MS. had Ι not had his publication before me. Both
to Tischendorf and to Belsheim therefore the present edition is largely
indebted. 1 cannot hope that in my own work Ι have obtained absolute
accuracy and correctness3 in so difficult a palimpsest as this, many of the
readings given must be partly conjectural; and even where there is no
doubt about the reading os the MS, mistakes cannot be avoided in tran-
scribing‚ and in revising proof-sheetS. In publishing the Oxsord critical
edition os the Vulgate‚ we have learnt by bittcr experience how errors
will constantly creep in, aster what seemcd to be the utmost care in
