agreement with b against f; in one marked instance, the order of verses
in Matt. v. 4, 5, b,s, q stand together against the other MSS. In five
instances b, q stand together against all the rest, in four q agrees with k
alone, in two with a and in two with d 3 in six q presents a peculiar
reading, though in one of these (Matt. v. 13) a kindred reading is found
in d and k. But still the substantial ground of the text seems os

every now and then, rather in single isolated readings and expres-
sions than for any spaces of noticeable length. The analysis of
further chapters of St. Matthew, so far as it has been carried, points in

against f rather than with it, and the text oscillates generally between a
