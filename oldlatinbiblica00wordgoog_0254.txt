xxii IN TRODUC T ION

Belsheim claimed to have read, but which, after repeated examination,
1 was unable to decipher.

The chapter and verse numbers have been taken. as in the previous
publications os this series, from the edition os R. Stephens printed in
1555, the first Latin Bible that possessed the modern verse enumeration.

I cannot close this introduction without expressing my thanks to
the officials at the Imperial Library at Vienna, for their unfailing
kindness and courtesy‚ and especially to my friend Dr. Rudols Beer. the
Secretary, whose readiness to assist me in every way has greatly light-
ened this pleasant task; also to Dr. Sanday‚ and to M. Samuel Berger,
whose constant attention and wise advice have been given me through-
out; my thanks to M. Berger must, as Ruskin somewhere sayS, ‘ remain
inadequate lest they become wearisomc.'

Ox roan,
sanuary 30, 1897.
